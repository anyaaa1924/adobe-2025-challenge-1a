5. Dockerfile

Use this final Dockerfile if you haven't already:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim

WORKDIR /app

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    libglib2.0-0 \
    libgl1-mesa-glx \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY . .

RUN pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

CMD ["python", "main.py"]

```

6. HTML File

You can run the html file to open up a window, a simple UI.
This allows user to upload output.json file to check about language and filter it out.
Other features like font, page number, heading, subheading and other details will be found in the output folder under a json file once the input is run.

#You can activate venv environment too on the system using python -m venv venv
then activating it.
